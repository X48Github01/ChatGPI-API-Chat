2023-01-06 09:56:30,419 - Here's a basic example of a Python script using CCXT to connect to an exchange:
2023-01-06 09:56:30,419 - 
2023-01-06 09:56:30,419 - # Import the CCXT library
2023-01-06 09:56:30,420 - import ccxt
2023-01-06 09:56:30,420 - 
2023-01-06 09:56:30,420 - # Create an instance of the exchange
2023-01-06 09:56:30,420 - exchange = ccxt.bitmex()
2023-01-06 09:56:30,421 - 
2023-01-06 09:56:30,421 - # Set API credentials
2023-01-06 09:56:30,421 - exchange.apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
2023-01-06 09:56:30,421 - exchange.secret = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
2023-01-06 09:56:30,421 - 
2023-01-06 09:56:30,422 - # Connect to the exchange
2023-01-06 09:56:30,422 - exchange.load_markets()
2023-01-06 09:56:30,422 - 
2023-01-06 09:56:30,422 - # Check connection status
2023-01-06 09:56:30,423 - if exchange.check_connected():
2023-01-06 09:56:30,423 -     print('Connected to the exchange!')
2023-01-06 09:56:30,423 - else:
2023-01-06 09:56:30,424 -     print('Unable to connect to the exchange.')
